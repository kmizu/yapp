# YAPP
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/kmizu/yapp.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/kmizu/yapp)

YAPP is Yet Another Packrat Parser Generator and provide optimizations that come from Rats! and is based on notion **Cut**.

Some optimizations usable in Yapp are explained in [my PASTE 2010 paper](http://ialab.cs.tsukuba.ac.jp/~mizusima/publications/paste513-mizushima.pdf).

Although the other optimizations are not explained enough,  I'd like to provide information in this document.

Currently, YAPP is fully written in Java and is compiled using sbt.  I'd like to port currenty Java code to Scala code.
